## Hi there 👋 Welcome to my little house  😊
My name is Vo Tuan. I'm a Data Analyst at the entry level and continuously improving myself 😉. Therefore, I ❤️ communicating with data and presenting its fun facts to people who are interested. 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on data-related tasks like cleaning data from insurance software, creating and tracking annual and monthly report, handling ad-hoc analysis using SQL etc.... ,  at an insurance office.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to automate the execution of the tasks above with Python and convey insights to stakeholders in an effective way.🤓
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a data analyst role in the product team. That's what I desire 😁
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love this job even though it might be unrelated to my field ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via my email: votuan666333@gmail.com

  Thank You and I Love You!
